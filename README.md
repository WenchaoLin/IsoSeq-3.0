# IsoSeq-3.0 : Generating full-length cDNA sequences for transcriptomics

The isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) application generates full-length cDNA sequences — from the 5’ end of transcripts to the poly-A tail — eliminating the need for transcriptome reconstruction using isoform-inference algorithms. The Iso-Seq method generates accurate information about alternatively spliced exons and transcriptional start sites. It also delivers information about poly-adenylation sites for transcripts up to 10 kb in length across the full complement of isoforms within targeted genes or the entire transcriptome.
